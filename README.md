### Project description
The goal of the senior design project is to design an obstacle avoiding sweeper from scratch. This project involves obstacle detection and maneuverability. In order to detect obstacles, two ultrasonic sensors, along with DC motors will be implemented. The cleaner itself, will be powered using a high power DC motor and will be made of reusable plastic. The motivation behind the project is to have the sweeper work without human interference. This will be beneficial and assist people with mobility issues, such as arthritis, so they donâ€™t have to keep bending over to change the direction of the sweeper when it collides with an obstacle. Instead, the sensors will detect obstacles on their own and decide which alternative route to take. Other motivation behind the project include the sweeper being convenient and saving time, as well as being compact and easy to use. Another motivation is to have the sweeper be easy maintenance and work on all floor types such as tile, hardwood, and carpet. There are several robotic cleaners out on the market already, but what differentiates our product from those is the cost, as well as our features. The body of our design is going to consist of reusable plastic so the cost of it will be significantly lower. Additionally in the future, the sweeper will have the ability to spot clean. Instead of having the sweeper clean a large area, the customer will have the ability to have the sweeper clean a specific spot.

### Prototype Design
Auto-sweeper consist of TIVA launchpad, 2 HC-SR04 Ultrasonic sensor, 2 DC motors and wheels, 1 DRV8833 dual motor driver. Two timers of the ARM Cortex M4 are used for calculating the distance of the obstacles using ultrasonic sensors. DC motor is driven by providing PWM voltage from the microcontroller. The architecture of the system is as follows:
